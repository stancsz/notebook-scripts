        "This script performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on an image file to extract and print the text contained within it. It utilizes the pytesseract library, which is a Python wrapper for Google’s Tesseract-OCR Engine. Before running the script, ensure that Tesseract-OCR is installed on your system and that pytesseract is available in your Python environment. The script handles basic errors such as file not found and reports them to the user. For best results, the image should have high contrast between text and background and be of high resolution."
